// Emojiable indicates whether or not a given rune might be an emoji and so can
// be followed by a presentation selector, per UTS#51 on Unicode Emoji.
// Various characters can be followed by 0xFE0E or 0xFE0F to select text or
// emoji variants and override normal rendering, but this is only well defined
// for the characters in a Consortium-maintained table.  In at least one
// terminal emulator, _some_ pictograms followed by the emoji presentation
// selector will emit garbage sequences instead of just the base pictogram.
//
// HOWEVER: various emojis from the Emoticons block can be given the text
// selector and it "works" in iTerm on macOS, but this list is not complete and
// so simple presence-in-generated-list is not sufficient.
// Going on gut (so probably wrong) am using the same list of "stuff in these
// blocks is probably not marked as the right width" as we use elsewhere.
