Files in this directory with names ending `.txt` are vendored copies of
external data and hereby explicitly excluded from copyright claims on my part.

Files in this directory with names matching `generated_*.go` are generated
code based upon the external data.  I make no copyright claims to the values
embedded in this code, as those are a programmatic transformation from the
public data.
