* Add enough tests to not be embarrassed
* Implement missing features:
  + other lookup sources
* Full strings of characters, and transformations?  Eg punycode?
* `character browse` to pull up an augmented UnicodeData.txt with chars in?
* `make licenses` to have `character license`, pulling in all licenses
  recursively

### Known Issues

Search via `character named -/` is a bit iffy on multiple words.  I need to
get more familiar with Ferret.
