# 2016-03-14: removed `tip` âˆµ `go vet` on Travis throwing false errors,
# complaining about missing format strings where they're most definitely

  # This is evil and wrong, but it's a container managed by Travis, and this is testing,
  # not CI which generates artifacts which we deploy, so can't leak out:

  - make dep
